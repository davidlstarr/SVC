The Wet Dry Chart displays, along the y-axis, the length of the river where water was present (blue) and absent (red) during the river’s driest time of year (mid-June) along the first ~50 miles of the San Pedro River north of the international boundary with Mexico as if the curvy river were stretched into a straight line. Depending on your selection, the x-axis displays this data for a single year (defaulting to the most recent year), or all years mapped (1999 to present) from left to right so you can see the change in wetted length from year to year. When hovering over a part of the chart, the corresponding river length appears on the map as highlighted in white. NOTE- please be patient when selecting “ALL” years, as it takes the WHIP a few moments to pull together a large batch of Wet Dry data.
